# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Odin project: Rock Paper Scissors


In this project I will be creating a rock, paper and scissors game, playing against the computer. This game will be played through the console.

I will be utilizing the skills I have learned about Javascript thus far. 


<!-- 
    First attempt at writing pseudocode for the rock paper scissors project:

    prompt user for input and store in variable.
    create a function where computer makes a choice between, rock, paper, scissors.
    
    create another function where user choice compares to computer choice and outputs the winner or tie.
